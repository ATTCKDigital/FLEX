## Global CSS
The `scss` folder holds all of the globally available styles for the site. Things such as grids, headline styles, layout styles, etc. 

These should serve as the basis for a functioning theme. Changes should be made to the files that set parameters/vars only (colors, fonts, general typography and iconography). Some items have variables that can be changed (such as the padding and margins sass files). 

### CSS Files
- `_animations.scss`: Common animations. 
- `_component.scss`: Basic component styles. 
- `_forms.scss`: Global form styles.  All form field styling should be done here.

# CHILD THEME BLOCK OVERRIDES

If the markup of a parent Gutenberg block needs to change, add it here in a folder with the same name. For example, to override the Feed block (a common use case), create a new folder in `gutenberg/blocks` called `block_feed`. Copy the existing `feed.php` markup into a new file in the new folder called `feed.php`.  Make changes as needed in this file.

# ATTCK Boilerplate
A boilerplate theme for ATTCK WordPress projects

See the README in `__GET_STARTED_HERE` to get started on your project!

## Theme Structure

### Components Structure
Components are the pieces of the theme.  Each component folder contains the following, specific to the component:
- markup (php file)
- sass file
- js file (if component has js aspect)
- readme.md specific to component
- acf field generator (the fields specific to the component are generated via this file)

#### Available Components
List of base components

#### Adding components
##### How to "enable" existing components

##### How to "add" new component

### Assets
Assets include fonts, images and svgs. SVGs are compiled by gulp into a global SVG file. SVGs should be used wherever possible.

### Global CSS
The `scss` folder holds all of the globally available styles for the site. Things such as grids, headline styles, layout styles, etc. 

These should serve as the basis for a functioning theme. Changes should be made to the files that set parameters only (colors, fonts, general typography and iconography). Some items have variables that can be changed (such as the padding and margins sass files). 

### Global JS
The boilerplate theme has a variety of existing javascript functions (nav animation, parallax, scroll detection, etc). These can be leveraged from any component using ES6 impoprt. See `Available Global JS Components` below for detailed information on each function.

#### Global Fields (always include)

- Google Tag Manager ID (`group_5b4cd6926e1bb.json`): Found in "Global Settings", allows the user to insert their own GTM Container ID. 
- Social Media Sharing (`group_5b16e72af37f3.json`): Added to all posts, CPTs and pages so user can override default generated OG meta tags.

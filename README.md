# ATTCK Boilerplate
A boilerplate theme for ATTCK WordPress projects

See the README in `__GET_STARTED_HERE` to get started on your project!

## Theme Structure

### Components Structure
Components are the pieces of the theme.  Each component folder contains the following, specific to the component:
- markup (php file)
- sass file
- js file (if component has js aspect)
- readme.md specific to component
- acf field generator (the fields specific to the component are generated via this file)

See detailed README.md in `components` folder.

### Assets
Assets include fonts, images and svgs. SVGs are compiled by gulp into a global SVG file. SVGs should be used wherever possible.

### Global CSS
The `scss` folder holds all of the globally available styles for the site. Things such as grids, headline styles, layout styles, etc. 

These should serve as the basis for a functioning theme. Changes should be made to the files that set parameters/vars only (colors, fonts, general typography and iconography). Some items have variables that can be changed (such as the padding and margins sass files). 

### Global JS
The boilerplate theme has a variety of existing javascript functions (nav animation, parallax, scroll detection, etc). These can be leveraged from any component using ES6 impoprt. See `Available Global JS Components` below for detailed information on each function.

See detailed README.md in `components` folder.

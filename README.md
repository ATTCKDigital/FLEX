# Flex Layout System Boilerplate
A boilerplate theme for Flex Layout System WordPress projects

> READ BEFORE cloning!

See the README in `__GET_STARTED_HERE` to get started on your project.

## Theme Structure

### Components Structure
Components are the pieces of the theme.  Each component folder contains the following, specific to the component:
- markup (php file)
- sass file
- js file (if component has js aspect)
- readme.md specific to component
- acf field generator (the fields specific to the component are generated via this file)

See detailed README.md in `components` folder.

#### Component Includes
Components can be included in any template file.

The `Utils::render_template()` function should be used to include all files.

See example of how to include a template in the README.md in `components` folder.

### Assets
Assets include fonts, images and svgs. SVGs are compiled by gulp into a global SVG file. SVGs should be used wherever possible.

### Global CSS
The `scss` folder holds all of the globally available styles for the site. Things such as grids, headline styles, layout styles, etc.

These should serve as the basis for a functioning theme. Changes should be made to the files that set parameters/vars only (colors, fonts, general typography and iconography). Some items have variables that can be changed (such as the padding and margins sass files).

### Global JS
The boilerplate theme has a variety of existing javascript functions (nav animation, parallax, scroll detection, etc). These can be leveraged from any component using ES6 impoprt. See `Available Global JS Components` in `js` folder for detailed information on each function.

## Plugin Settings/Info

### Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)
This theme uses ACF to allow for dynamic layouts as well as global settings that can be adjusted by an admin.

Download the latest version from ACF using the ATTCK login (see LastPass for login info).
_The version of ACF required for the boilerplate is still in beta.  As of 3/29/19 - Version 5.8.0-beta4.1_

### ACF Local JSON Manager
This allows syncing of json files from within each component. Once installed and activated, no changes should need to be made.

Once installed, a dropdown will appear in the admin (in the toolbar at the top). When you create or edit ACF fields, select the registered component from the drop down to ensure that the fields save in the correct locations. To edit or add global ACF fields, select "disable overrides".

//okatodo: potentially change site logo to be part of customizer instead of an acf field?
